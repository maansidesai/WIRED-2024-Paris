This is a sample BIDS dataset for the WIRED ICM course in Paris, France in March 2024.

This contains intracranial recordings collected by the Hamilton Lab at the University of Texas at Austin. These recordings include examples of evoked data during natural listening tasks along with some examples of seizure-related activity and vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) artifact for illustrative purposes. All procedures were approved by the University of Texas at Austin Institutional Review Board. 

*Funding:* Support was provided by the National Institutes of Health National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (R01 DC018579, to LSH).

Tasks:
-------

1. `movietrailers` - this task involves patients listening to movie clips from various Pixar, Disney, Dreamworks, and other movies. We have published previously using these stimuli in EEG (Desai et al. 2021).
2. `timit4` and `timit5` - these tasks involve patients listening to subsets of the TIMIT acoustic phonetic corpus (Garofolo et al 1993). The events provided in the dataset mark the onset and offset of each sentence. In `timit4`, each sentence is unique, while in `timit5`, 10 sentences are repeated 10 times. This is the same stimulus set used in Mesgarani et al. 2014, Hamilton et al. 2018, Hamilton et al. 2021, and Desai et. al 2021.

Notes:
-------

* The movie trailer data for subject W1 was acquired at the start of a generalized tonic clonic seizure, and the research session was terminated. Large, synchronized spikes can be observed on multiple channels on the right parietal grid throughout the iEEG data.
* The TIMIT data for subject W2 is an example of fairly clean sentence evoked data. 
* The TIMIT data for subject W3 is a good example of on-and-off VNS artifact. The VNS has a strong artifact at ~20 Hz. Some patients with epilepsy may have these implanted devices to help control their seizures, so you should know how to spot artifact-related activity. Despite these artifacts, the evoked responses to sentences are quite strong.
* The acquisition number (B3, B8, etc) has to do with the order in which this task was run relative to other tasks in an iEEG session, and can be ignored here.
