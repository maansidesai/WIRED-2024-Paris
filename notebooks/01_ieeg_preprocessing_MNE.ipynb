    "This notebook will show you how to preprocess intracranial EEG using MNE-python. This uses an iEEG dataset on sentence listening which can be accessed [here](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003688/versions/1.0.7/metadata). This notebook covers the basics of how to look at iEEG data, interpret effects of referencing, and inspect data quality. In part 2, we will cover high gamma extraction and referencing. The method of high gamma extraction is identical to that used in [Hamilton et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.04.033) and [Hamilton et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.07.019).\n",

    "# A high-level summary for preprocessing intracranial data\n",

    "### Frequency Bands\n",
    "\n",
    "EEG records neural responses best in the range of 1-25Hz (recall our PSD plots from last notebook). However, ECoG can record from a much higher range of frequency, up into gamma and high gamma (70-150Hz) bands. This is especially exciting for us speech researchers, because high-gamma band activity has been correlated with a lot of speech stimuli!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to extract high gamma response we need to do something called a Hilbert transform. We'll talk more about that in `02_ieeg_preprocessing_MNE_epochs` notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "ECoG is invasive, that is, it's placed directly on the surface of the brain (or in the brain, in the case of depth electrodes). Some of the artifacts we may encounter are related to the patient's epilepsy or other movement-related noise. We'll go over examples of what these artifacts look like. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Referencing\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different methods that people use for rereferencing intracranial data. For sEEG/ECoG instead we use a common average reference (CAR), which means we are referencing based on the average activity at all electrodes. But we will go over a couple of rereferencing methods and will plot the neural data to give you an idea of how the data look. "
