# WIRED 2024 - MNE Python Tutorial lead by Maansi Desai, Alexandre Gramfort, and Apolline Mellot

# Getting Started
Welcome to the WIRED 2024 [MNE Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) Tutorial! If you're reading this, hopefully you are getting started learning how to use python and jupyter notebooks to do some analysis of neuroscience data! In this tutorial, we will be using a BIDS dataset collected from a combination of intracranial (sEEG data) as well as non-invasive brain recording modalities such as EEG and MEG. The tutorials here are organized into Jupyter notebooks that will go through a series of concepts that will give you the foundation for what you need to preprocess and plot epochs using [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html). 

# List of notebooks

## 01_ieeg_preprocessing_MNE

First notebook which will load, plot, rereference, and inspect data for artifact rejection.

## 02_ieeg_preprocessing_MNE_epochs

The second notebook will involve learning about how to epoch your data.  Epoched data allows you to calculate averaged responses to events of interest (event-related potentials) and can be conducted based on the onset of the sentence, a phoneme onset, or word onset (as examples to consider).
