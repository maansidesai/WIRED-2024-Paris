## Getting Started
Welcome to the WIRED 2024 [MNE Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) Tutorial! If you're reading this, hopefully you are getting started learning how to use python and jupyter notebooks to do some analysis of neuroscience data! In this tutorial, we will be using several [BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)-formatted [intracranial datasets](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modality-specific-files/intracranial-electroencephalography.html). The tutorials here are organized into Jupyter notebooks that will go through a series of concepts that will give you the foundation for what you need to preprocess and plot epochs using [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html). 

## Installation Instructions
* First you should install [MNE-python](https://mne.tools/stable/install/index.html). We recommend using the standalone installer. Note that for Mac M2 chips this may not work, but you can try running the installer from your command line instead, e.g.

```bash
# Only try this if the standalone installer doesn't work on mac:
sudo installer -verbose -pkg MNE-Python-1.6.1_0-macOS_M1.pkg -target /
```

* Open up the MNE-prompt, and in the MNE environment, install `nb_conda_kernels` for better experience with Jupyter notebooks. See MNE's [Advanced Installation Instructions](https://mne.tools/stable/install/advanced.html) for more information.

```bash
conda install --name=base nb_conda_kernels

```
* Clone using git(or [download](https://github.com/maansidesai/WIRED-2024-Paris/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)) this repository in your directory of choice on your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maansidesai/WIRED-2024-Paris/
cd path/to/WIRED-2024-Paris
```

* Start up MNE-prompt (or your MNE environment), and install the required python libraries in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* If you experience any errors with the pip install above (for example, `pyfftw` has some issues with newer Silicon chip Macs (e.g. M2), you can do the following `conda install`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pyfftw
```

* Install the [openneuro-py](https://github.com/hoechenberger/openneuro-py) client (see the link for more detailed instructions).

```bash
# via conda:
conda install -c conda-forge openneuro-py
# or via pip:
pip install openneuro-py
```

* Download the datasets for this tutorial. We recommend that you place them in a `data` folder in the repo (this will be ignored by `git` by default -- the files are too big for git repositories). The installation below will install all the data from our sample dataset and one subject's data from [Berezutskaya et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01173-0). If you wish to download more data, you may do that on your own.

```bash
# Launch MNE-prompt, then do the following
cd /path/to/WIRED-2024-Paris/notebooks
mkdir data
cd data
openneuro-py download --dataset ds003688 --include sub-06
openneuro-py download --dataset ds004993
```

## Datasets used to demonstrate iEEG data preprocessing and for plotting evoked responses:

1) Data collected from [three pediatric sEEG patients in the Hamilton Lab](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004993/versions/1.1.1). This is ~300 MB.

2) [Berezutskaya et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01173-0) iEEG and fMRI data from movie viewing. See [openneuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003688/versions/1.0.7) page for more details. This is 155 MB for one participant, and 15 GB for the whole dataset.

## List of notebooks
### [`01_ieeg_preprocessing_MNE`](notebooks/01_ieeg_prepcossing_MNE)

First notebook which will load, plot, rereference, and inspect data for artifact rejection.

### [`02_ieeg_preprocessing_MNE_epochs`](notebooks/02_ieeg_preprocessing_MNE_epochs.ipynb)
The second notebook will involve learning about how to epoch your data.  Epoched data allows you to calculate averaged responses to events of interest (event-related potentials) and can be conducted based on the onset of the sentence, a phonene onset, or word onset (as examples to consider).

### [`03_plot_electrodes`](notebooks/02_plot_electrodes.ipynb)

### [`04_ieeg_breakout_MNE`](notebooks/04_ieeg_breakout_MNE.ipynb)
